# Pulbot

Pulbot is a desktop task manager with a chat-style interface. You enter short
commands to create todos, deadlines, and events, and Pulbot saves your tasks
between sessions.

## Features

- Create todos, deadlines, and events.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Delete tasks by their displayed number.
- Find tasks by a case-insensitive keyword.
- View deadlines and events that occur on a specific date.
- Reject duplicate tasks before they are saved.
- Store task data automatically in `data/pulbot.txt`.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 25
- A desktop environment that supports JavaFX

The Gradle wrapper downloads the required build tools and JavaFX dependencies.
You don't need to install Gradle separately.

## Run Pulbot

1. Clone the repository and open its directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/pulas2345/ip.git
   cd ip
   ```

2. Confirm that your terminal uses JDK 25:

   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

   On macOS with SDKMAN, you can select the required JDK with this command:

   ```shell
   sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew run
   ```

   On Windows, run `gradlew.bat run` instead.

## Use commands

Enter commands in the text field at the bottom of the Pulbot window.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `todo DESCRIPTION` | Add a task without a date. | `todo read chapter 3` |
| `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE_TIME` | Add a task with a deadline. | `deadline submit report /by 18/9/2026 2359` |
| `event DESCRIPTION /from DATE_TIME /to DATE_TIME` | Add an event with a start and end time. | `event tutorial /from 18/9/2026 1000 /to 18/9/2026 1100` |
| `list` | Display every task. | `list` |
| `find KEYWORD` | Find tasks whose descriptions contain a keyword. | `find report` |
| `on DATE` | Display deadlines and events occurring on a date. | `on 18/9/2026` |
| `mark NUMBER` | Mark a task as complete. | `mark 2` |
| `unmark NUMBER` | Mark a task as incomplete. | `unmark 2` |
| `delete NUMBER` | Delete a task. | `delete 2` |
| `bye` | Close Pulbot. | `bye` |

Use `d/M/yyyy HHmm` for date-times and `d/M/yyyy` for dates. Pulbot interprets
times using the computer's local time zone.

### Duplicate tasks

Pulbot rejects a new task when an existing task has the same type, description,
and date-time details. Description comparison ignores capitalization and
surrounding spaces. Completion status doesn't make a task unique.

For example, if `todo read book` already exists, Pulbot rejects
`todo READ BOOK` with this message:

```text
This task already exists in your list.
```

## Build a runnable JAR

Create a JAR that includes the JavaFX dependencies:

```shell
./gradlew shadowJar
```

Gradle creates `build/libs/Pulbot.jar`. Run it with JDK 25:

```shell
java -jar build/libs/Pulbot.jar
```

## Run development checks

Run the automated tests and coding-standard checks before submitting a change:

```shell
./gradlew test checkstyleMain checkstyleTest
```

Run every verification task and rebuild the application with this command:

```shell
./gradlew build shadowJar
```

## Project structure

```text
src/main/java/pulbot/
├── command/    Command parsing and execution
├── storage/    File loading and saving
├── task/       Task types and task-list operations
├── ui/         Console presentation
└── *.java      Application and JavaFX controllers
```

Tests follow the same package structure under `src/test/java/pulbot/`.

## Data storage

Pulbot creates `data/pulbot.txt` when it first saves a task. The application
manages this file automatically. Closing and reopening Pulbot reloads the saved
tasks.

If the file contains invalid data, the console application reports the error.
The graphical application starts with an empty task list so that you can still
use Pulbot.
